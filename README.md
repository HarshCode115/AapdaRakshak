AapdaRakshak is a disaster management web platform designed to support government organizations and citizens during natural or man-made disasters.

🛡️ Risk Mitigation & Preparedness – Provides reliable alerts and safety guidelines to minimize risk before and during disasters.

🤝 Community Involvement – Empowers normal people to contribute resources, volunteer, and help victims in crisis.

🔎 Post-Disaster Support – Helps affected families by providing tools to search and reconnect with lost relatives.

🏛️ Government-Focused – Enables authorities to broadcast verified alerts and instructions to the public in real time.

This project aligns with the Disaster Management hackathon theme by covering planning, mitigation, response, and recovery phases of disasters. It bridges the gap between authorities and citizens, ensuring faster communication, coordinated relief, and community-driven resilience.
